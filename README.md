# Physics of Complex Networks - Final Project

## Introduction
Final project for the Physics of Complex Networks course, from the Physics of Data Masters degree (UNIPD). The project is composed of three tasks, which cover theoretical and practical aspects of complex networks:
- **Song-Havlin-Makse self-similar model:** The aim of this model is to explain the characteristic features of empirical scale–free fractal and non–fractal networks by means of a single growth process, that has the concept of renormalisation at its core.
- **Sandpile dynamics on complex networks:** The behaviour of the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model is studied on complex networks. The task is focused on two main types of networks: scale–free networks, where the power–law behaviour of failure cascades depends on the degree distribution, and interdependent networks, where the interconnection between systems can either mitigate or exacerbate failure cascades.
- **Data analytics of public trans- port networks:** A reconstruction of the public transport networks from the Citylines dataset is performed. A set of methods and heuristics are developed in order to reconstruct and infer networks from the geographical location of nodes and edges, which are then characterised by means of standard topological descriptors.

## Structure of the repository
The project is separated into three main parts:
- **code:** All of the necessary code for each task is developed and documented here. This includes all of the simulation, network generation, data analysis and visualization tools.
- **data:** The generated networks and simulation output from each task are stored here.
- **latex:** Contains all of the text and image files required to reproduce the final report.

Additionally, a report with the details and results achieved for each task can be found in the parent folder.
